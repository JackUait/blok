# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This project grows stronger with every issue, discussion, and pull request, so your help is appreciated.

## How to contribute

### 1. Ask or propose first
If you’re planning something non-trivial, open a Discussion or Issue to confirm direction before writing code.

### 2. Fork and branch
Create a feature branch from `main`. Keep changes focused and scoped to a single topic.

### 3. Follow the code style
Use the existing patterns in the codebase as a reference.  
Write clean, typed, testable code. Keep diffs minimal.

### 4. Add tests
If you change behavior or add features, include tests that cover the new logic.

### 5. Update docs where needed
If your change affects usage or configuration, update the relevant documentation or comments.

### 6. Submit a PR
Describe the motivation, solution, and any trade-offs.  
Link related issues or discussions. Keep the description concise.

## Code of conduct
Be constructive. Assume good intent. Respect the time and effort of others.
