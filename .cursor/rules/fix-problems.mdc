# Fix Problems Policy

## Core Principle
VERY IMPORTANT: When encountering ANY problem in the code—such as TypeScript errors, linting issues, runtime bugs, accessibility violations, or performance problems—you or any other problem MUST find a proper way to fix it. Do NOT silence, suppress, or avoid the problem using workarounds like `// @ts-ignore`, `any` types, or ignoring linter warnings.

## Preferred Approaches
- **Refactor for correctness**: Resolve issues by improving the code structure, using precise types, type guards, proper error handling, and best practices.
- **Investigate root causes**: Use tools like debugging, logging, or code searches to understand why the problem occurs before fixing it.
- **Align with existing rules**: Follow related policies such as the Fix TypeScript Errors Policy (adapt for other languages), ESLint configurations, and accessibility guidelines.
- **Test the fix**: After fixing, verify with tests, linting runs (e.g., `yarn lint:fix`), or manual checks to ensure the problem is truly resolved without introducing new issues.

## When to Apply
- During any code editing, reviewing, or generation task.
- Proactively scan for and fix problems in affected files using available tools (e.g., read_lints, grep, codebase_search).
- If a problem persists after reasonable efforts, document it clearly and suggest next steps rather than suppressing it.

## Notes
- This policy promotes robust, high-quality code that is easier to maintain and less prone to future issues.
- If unsure how to fix a problem, use tools to gather more information or break it into smaller, solvable parts rather than bypassing it.
