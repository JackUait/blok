## It's Blok!

**Blok** is a headless, highly extensible rich text editor built for developers who need to implement a block-based editing experience (similar to Notion) without building it from scratch.

Unlike traditional `contenteditable` solutions that treat text as a single HTML blob, Blok treats every piece of content—paragraphs, headings, images, lists—as an individual Block. This architecture allows for drag-and-drop reordering, complex nesting, and a strictly typed data structure.

**Key Features:**

**🧱 Block Architecture**: Content is structured as JSON data, not raw HTML, making it easy to parse, store, and render anywhere.

**⚡ Slash Commands**: Includes a built-in "Slash Menu" (/) for quick formatting and inserting media.

**🖱️ Drag & Drop**: Native support for rearranging blocks with intuitive handles.

**🔌 Extensible Plugin System**: Easily create custom blocks to fit your specific use case.
