# Frontend Simplicity Principle

When working on frontend tasks, prioritize simple, straightforward solutions over complex implementations.

## Guidelines

### Keep it simple
- **Prefer basic approaches**: Choose standard patterns over custom abstractions unless there's a clear benefit
- **Avoid premature optimization**: Don't add complexity for performance gains that haven't been measured
- **Use existing libraries**: Leverage well-established libraries rather than building custom solutions

### Component design
- **Single responsibility**: Components should do one thing well
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Keep component trees shallow and manageable
- **Prefer composition over inheritance**: Use composition patterns for reusable behavior

### State management
- **Local state first**: Use local component state before reaching for global state management
- **Simple patterns**: Prefer useState/useReducer over complex state machines unless necessary
- **Avoid over-abstraction**: Don't create unnecessary abstractions for simple state logic

### Code organization
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that explain the purpose
- **Minimal files**: Avoid splitting simple features across multiple files
- **Straightforward logic**: Write code that's easy to follow and debug

### When complexity is justified
Only add complexity when:
- It solves a measured performance problem
- It significantly improves user experience
- It enables critical functionality
- The team agrees it's necessary

## Examples

```tsx
// ✅ Simple and clear
const UserProfile = ({ user }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      {isEditing ? (
        <EditForm onSave={() => setIsEditing(false)} />
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsEditing(true)}>Edit</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

// ❌ Overcomplicated
const UserProfile = ({ user }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(profileReducer, initialProfileState);
  const editingContext = useContext(EditingContext);
  const formManager = useFormManager();

  // Complex logic that could be simplified...
};
```

Remember: Code is read more than it's written. Choose the solution that future developers can understand quickly.
