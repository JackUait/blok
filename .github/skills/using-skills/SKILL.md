# Using Skills

## The Rule

**If a skill applies to your task, you MUST use it.**

Not optional. Not "when convenient." Skills encode lessons from failures - ignoring them repeats those failures.

## How to Access Skills

1. **Check for relevant skills** before starting any task
2. **Read the skill completely** - don't skim
3. **Follow the skill's guidance** - it prevents known pitfalls
4. **Announce skill usage**: "I'm using the [skill-name] skill to [purpose]"

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply:

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - determine HOW to approach
2. **Implementation skills second** (TDD, patterns) - guide execution

"Let's build X" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills
"Fix this bug" → systematic-debugging first, then TDD for the fix

## Red Flags - You're Rationalizing

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I already know this" | Skills have specific patterns. Read anyway. |
| "This is too simple" | Simple tasks still benefit from process |
| "I'll check skills later" | Later never comes. Check now. |
| "This feels productive" | Busy ≠ effective. Process first. |
| "Just this once" | Exceptions become habits |

## Available Skills

Browse skills in `.github/skills/` directory:

- **using-skills** - This introduction (you're reading it)

## User Instructions

User instructions say WHAT, not HOW.

"Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows. The skill determines the approach.
