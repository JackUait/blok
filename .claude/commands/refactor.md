Review the following code and provide a refactoring-focused analysis:

1. Identify any dead, unused, or redundant code.
2. Point out unnecessary complexity and suggest simpler alternatives.
3. Evaluate whether the implementation correctly and efficiently solves the task.
4. Highlight deviations from best practices (readability, maintainability, performance).
5. Check for potential TypeScript typing issues and ESLint violations, especially:
   - overly broad types (any, unknown)
   - missing or incorrect generics
   - unsafe type assertions
   - null/undefined handling

For each issue:
- Explain why it is a problem
- Suggest a concrete fix (code examples where helpful)

Prioritize issues by impact.

If applicable, suggest small follow-up refactors that could be done later (out of scope for this change).
