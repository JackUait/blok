description: Enforce fixing TypeScript errors by improving code quality, not suppressing them

# Fix TypeScript Errors Policy

- **Core Principle**: Always resolve TypeScript errors by refactoring code to be type-safe, rather than suppressing them with `any`, `// @ts-ignore`, or similar workarounds.
- **Preferred Approaches**:
  - Use precise types, type guards, discriminated unions, and proper narrowing to eliminate errors.
  - Avoid the non-null assertion operator (`!`) and `any` types as per project guidelines.
  - Refactor functions, components, and logic to align with TypeScript's type system.
- **When to Apply**:
  - For any TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`), prioritize fixing errors during edits.
  - After making changes, run `yarn lint:fix` or similar commands to ensure compliance.
- **Alignment with Existing Rules**:
  - This reinforces the ESLint Fix-First Policy: Fix issues flagged by TypeScript/ESLint by improving code, not silencing linters.
  - Ensure accessibility and best practices are maintained while resolving types.
- **Notes**:
  - If a TypeScript error persists after reasonable refactoring, consult the ESLint configuration or seek clarification on intended behavior, but do not suppress it locally.
  - Promote code that is both type-safe and adheres to React/JS best practices.
