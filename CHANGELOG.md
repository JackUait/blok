# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.19.2](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.19.1...v0.19.2) (2026-06-20)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **Types** — `OutputBlockData`'s `data` field is now typed `Record<string, unknown>` instead of `any` (matching `BlockToolData` and `SavedData`). Reading a property off a saved block's `data` — e.g. on `save()` output — now yields `unknown` rather than `any`, so code that indexes into `block.data` may need a cast or type guard. This is a type-only change with no runtime effect.

### Bug Fixes

- **Types** — Published `.d.ts` declarations are now self-contained and no longer re-export raw `src/*.ts`. A bare `import { Blok } from '@jackuait/blok'` previously dragged editor source into the consumer's TypeScript program (through `tooltip` and `popover` → `flipper`), surfacing internal type errors under strict consumer flags such as `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. The `tooltip` and `popover` declarations now inline their public types, so consuming the package no longer type-checks Blok's internals. (The opt-in `/markdown` subpath is unchanged.)
- **Types** — The published declarations are now internally consistent under `skipLibCheck: false`. Fixed an incorrect `BlockToolData` import path in the `database`/`header`/`list` tool declarations (which also produced spurious "incorrectly extends `BlockTool`" errors), added a missing `InlineToolConstructable`/`InlineToolConstructorOptions` import in the type entry, and removed phantom `Dictionary`/`DictValue` re-exports.

### Maintenance

- **Dependencies** — Moved `nanoid` to `devDependencies`; it is bundled into every dist artifact and was never a runtime external.

## [0.19.1](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.19.0...v0.19.1) (2026-06-20)

### Features

- **Types** — `isReady` now resolves with the fully-initialized `Blok` instance (was `Promise<void>`), so `const editor = await blok.isReady` yields a ready, fully-typed editor without a cast. New exported `PendingBlok` type describes the surface available synchronously after `new Blok()` and before `isReady` resolves (`isReady`, `destroy`, `theme`, `width`) — type a reference held during that window as `PendingBlok` instead of widening to `Partial<Blok>`, then await `isReady` to narrow it to the full API. `new Blok()` still returns the full `Blok`, so existing usage is unaffected.

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.18.0...v0.19.0) (2026-06-20)

### Features

- **Width** — New public `width` API on the editor instance: `instance.width.get()`, `set('full' | 'narrow')`, and `toggle()` switch the content layout between `'narrow'` (the default, constrained to `--max-width-content`) and `'full'` (the content `max-width` is removed so it fills its container). It mirrors the `theme` API, including buffering a `set()` call made before the editor is ready and replaying it once the editor is initialized.

### Bug Fixes

- **Types** — Declare the `history` API on the exported `Blok` instance type. `history` (`clear()`, `undo()`/`redo()`, `canUndo()`/`canRedo()`) was already available at runtime; consumers no longer need to cast the instance to reach it.

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.17.0...v0.18.0) (2026-06-19)

### Features

- **Audio** — New native Audio block tool. Now-playing card with cover art (lazy `music-metadata` extraction), a waveform canvas with click/drag seek, transport controls (play/pause, volume, playback speed, loop, keyboard shortcuts, persisted preferences), file and URL upload, paste handling routed away from the File block, read-only support, and i18n across all locales. The player card is a full-bleed redesign — a tall cover panel (music-note placeholder when there is no art), a hero waveform scrubber with rounded bars, a slim transport bar, and motion polish.
- **Media** — Image, video, and audio blocks now accept any file of their media family (`image/*`, `video/*`, `audio/*`) by default. Restrict the accepted types through the existing `types` config, which now accepts both exact MIME types (`image/png`) and family wildcards (`image/*`).

### Bug Fixes

- **Types** — Export `File`, `Audio`, and `Video` (and their data/config/uploader types) and add the `file`/`audio`/`video` keys to `defaultBlockTools` from the `@jackuait/blok/tools` types entry. The runtime already exported these tools; consumers no longer need a local ambient type shim to import them.

### Maintenance

- **Playground** — Audio block states in the block-states gallery (real ID3-tagged track and a "No cover art" state) plus an e2e harness for insert/upload/play/seek.

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.16.1...v0.17.0) (2026-06-19)

### Features

- **Video** — New native Video block with a custom Airbnb-style player, brought to YouTube parity: full keyboard control (`j`/`l`/`k`, `0`–`9`, `Home`/`End`, frame-step, volume, speed), a scrubber with buffered range, hover frame-preview tooltip and mini progress bar, an in-player gear menu (Notion-style playback speed with glide, loop, ambient-glow intensity), and view modes — picture-in-picture, a FLIP-morphed theater/cinema mode, and a fade-in ambient glow. Player polish includes click-to-toggle play/pause, a centre play/pause burst, press-and-hold for 2× playback, arrow-key ±5s seek with side indicators, idle auto-hide, buffer spinner, time-remaining toggle, right-click menu, stats overlay and persisted preferences.
- **Video** — Custom fullscreen surface with a top caption bar, a "Hide controls" tune for a control-free player, and GIF-style autoplay/loop tunes.
- **Image** — Auto-convert dropped, pasted and remote-URL GIFs into a looping Video block via WebCodecs + webm-muxer, gated by the `convertGifToVideo` config (default on); the original GIF is kept on CORS failure, with a "Converting…" label shown during conversion.
- **Media** — 30MB default upload limit with per-type `maxSize` configuration and human-readable too-large errors.

### Bug Fixes

- **Paste** — URL paste always prompts now; the previous auto-embed behaviour has been removed. **Breaking:** consumers relying on silent auto-embed must opt in through the paste menu.
- **Video** — Reserve the aspect ratio before metadata loads to prevent squeeze-on-load, centre and letterbox the fullscreen player, strip editor chrome in fullscreen, and hide the bottom mini progress bar while fullscreen.
- **Video** — Exit theater mode reliably on Escape via a capture-phase listener with a smooth deferred dismiss, and drive the scrubber fill with `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth playback tracking.

### Maintenance

- **Build** — Move `webm-muxer` to devDependencies so it is bundled rather than treated as an external runtime dependency.
- **README** — Replace the logo with the optimized noodle mascot.
- **Playground** — Use real self-hosted videos in the block-states gallery.

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.15.1...v0.16.0) (2026-06-16)

### Features

- **File** — New File block tool. Tabbed empty state with upload (validation, progress bar, cancel), URL and drag-and-drop; per-type icon and tint; editable filename; consumer upload endpoints and download card. Rich preview modal dispatched by kind: PDF (top-layer modal with open-in-new-tab), Office (docx/xlsx/pptx via lazy renderers, xlsx parsed through JSZip), and text/code/markdown — including advanced markdown (math, footnotes, references, alerts, anchors, safe block-level raw HTML) with an animated Rendered ⇄ Raw toggle. Read-only support, i18n in every locale, and Storybook stories.
- **Embed** — Generic embed: frame arbitrary URLs through a gated resolver, offered in the paste menu behind the `linkPaste.allowGenericEmbed` flag with an `api.config` accessor. Replace the source via an empty-state URL bar and an overlay more-menu item.
- **Migration** — Complete Editor.js block-type coverage plus a drop-in UMD build; adapt legacy Editor.js inline tools and `linkTool` data.
- **Playground** — Block-states selector as a fixed left side menu; real docx/xlsx/pptx, code and text samples for the File block; richer quarterly-budget sheet; File block wired into the editor demo.

### Bug Fixes

- **Table** — Resolve merged-cell coordinate bugs; preserve merges on load; split overlapped merges on paste so no destination data is dropped; keep empty cells editable on the read-only→edit toggle; harden input, clipboard and move-guard handling.
- **File** — Unbreak pptx preview; vertically center the preview modal; stop wrong-colour strips and toggle flicker during preview transitions; block `javascript:` URLs in download hrefs.
- **Build** — Make the published install self-contained (ship `src`, keep markdown and nanoid as runtime deps) so bundlephobia can build; green the self-contained-install and css-token audits.

### Maintenance

- **Refactor** — Extract table visual-subsystem orchestration into `TableSubsystems`; split `BlockOperations` into focused worker classes; share the media uploader empty state across the image and file tools.
- **Code** — Cover every Prism token in both the light and dark themes.
- **Lint** — Resolve all lint errors by root cause and mute advisory-only rules.
- **Docs** — Refresh the README tool list and entry points; add a File block tool reference entry.

## [0.15.1](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1) (2026-06-13)

### Bug Fixes

- **Types** — Declare `Embed` and `Bookmark` (and their `defaultBlockTools` entries) in the published `@jackuait/blok/tools` types. The runtime exported them in 0.15.0 but the `.d.ts` did not, so `import { Embed, Bookmark }` failed to typecheck.

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.14.1...v0.15.0) (2026-06-12)

### Features

- **Link Paste** — Pasting a URL now offers a Notion-style menu to keep it as a link, or convert it into a Bookmark card or rich Embed block. The pasted link shows immediately with the menu anchored at its end, and menu labels name the detected link type via provider metadata.
- **Embed** — Worldwide embed registry covering ~115 services across video, audio, social, documents, design and developer domains, including Google published docs/forms and draw.io. Per-source minimum resize widths keep each provider's iframe legible, and fixed-width providers hug their content with figure, handles and toolbar.
- **Bookmark** — Notion-parity bookmark card with a dev unfurl endpoint; crawler-UA retry recovers metadata from bot-blocked sites.
- **Playground** — Smooth cross-fade theme switching via View Transitions, plus an Airbnb-style neutral redesign.

### Bug Fixes

- **Embed** — Preserve the live iframe across every editor action: caption and alignment toggles now apply in place instead of reloading the player. Selection highlight hugs the figure dimensions.
- **Drag & Drop** — FLIP-animate the column drop moment and slim the vertical drop bar to read like the horizontal line.
- **Security** — Harden URL-scheme filtering and neutralize XSS gaps in markdown paste, the inline link tool, and the paste/render pipeline.
- **Tools** — Implement `setReadOnly` on embed, bookmark and column tools so read-only toggles in place without a full re-render.
- **Icons** — Unify the icon set on the 20×20 / 1.25 house spec; refine heading family, quote, caption, pencil, cells, toggles, and numbered-list glyphs.
- **CI** — Pin Node 24.14.1 to dodge a Playwright install hang; share Playwright setup to stop Storybook browser install hanging; repair 6 failing CI specs (5 stale expectations, 1 real drop-indicator regression).

### Maintenance

- **Dependencies** — Resolve all 52 open Dependabot alerts; bump brace-expansion, ws, smol-toml.
- **Tests** — Embed/bookmark/link stories with screenshot baselines, wave-2 embed visual-regression baselines, verified real sample URLs replacing fixtures, refreshed `main.css` golden snapshot.
- **Docs & Playground** — Embed, bookmark and link entries in tools data and the editor demo.

## [0.14.1](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.14.0...v0.14.1) (2026-06-08)

### Features

- **Tools** — Register the Columns tool with a single `Columns` group key. Tool-group "provides" manifests expand into their underlying block tools during `prepare()`, so consumers add one key instead of wiring each block.

### Bug Fixes

- **Tools** — Export `Columns` from public types for single-key registration; keep `defaultBlockTools` settings-only so the group key forwards settings without re-registering.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/JackUait/blok/compare/v0.13.2...v0.14.0) (2026-06-05)

### Features

- **Columns** — New side-by-side layout tool (#67). Create 2–5 column presets from the toolbox, or drag a block beside another to spawn a column. Drop anywhere left/right of a block to make a new column, or into a column body to stack inside it. Columns nest, auto-unwrap when emptied, and stack vertically on narrow viewports.
- **Columns** — "Turn into columns" command wraps a multi-block selection into a column layout, available from the Convert-to menu.
- **Columns** — Hover-revealed resize separators between columns: drag to resize, keyboard-resizable with ARIA slider semantics, double-click a divider to equalize widths.
- **Columns** — Horizontal arrow keys traverse between sibling columns; new columns animate in Notion-style.
- **Inline Toolbar** — Appears instantly on selection release, no animation delay.

### Bug Fixes

- **Inline Toolbar** — Removed entry animation that delayed appearance.

### Maintenance

- **i18n** — Column resize aria-labels and turn-into-columns strings across all locales.
- **CI** — Repair unit tests, e2e merge, and mirror push on master; mirror push works for both branch and tag events.
- **Tests** — Exhaustive block-in-column compatibility suite, live-drag lifecycle specs for every block type, multi-select block-settings header i18n regression.
- **Playground** — Columns example in the editor demo and block-states gallery.
